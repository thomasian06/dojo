# dojo
An environment repo which turns a workspace into a dojo.

### Linux Environment
Source will include Dockerfiles containing examples of Ubuntu and Alpine (TODO) containers with compilers and build essentials.

### Neovim Environment
Under `nvim` you'll find the contents of my `.config/nvim`, which includes some stuff!

### Python Environment
Under `python` you'll find scripts/dockerfiles to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (my package manager of choice), along with files for starting a python project with poetry. Linters ([black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) as a static type checker) all bundled for use via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Cookiecutter repo coming soon.

### Shell Environment
Under `shell` you'll find my zsh configs and plugins ([oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)).

### Tmux Config
Under `tmux` you'll find some nifty shortcuts, remaps, and the rose-pine theme to your editor. I use the `Meslo LGS` font family.
